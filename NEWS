* Changes in 0.1.1 (compared to 0.1.0)

** Improve heuristics of bytevector size calculation in ‘uncompress’

   ‘uncompress’ now makes a better job at guessing the size of the
   output bytevector.

** ‘make-zlib-input-port’ & co. inherit the input port’s encoding

   ‘make-gzip-input-port’, ‘make-gzip-output-port’,
   ‘make-zlib-output-port’, and ‘make-zlib-input-port’ now inherit the
   encoding of their input port.

* Changes in 0.1.0 (compared to 0.0.1)

** New procedures: ‘make-zlib-input-port’, ‘make-zlib-output-port’

   These procedures and the companion ‘call-with-zlib-*’ procedures
   provide an alternative to the ‘make-gzip-*’ and ‘call-with-gzip-*’
   procedures; unlike those, they operate on all types of ports, not
   just file ports.

   These procedures also support multiple formats: raw “deflate”,
   “zlib”, and “gzip”.

** New ‘compress’ and ‘uncompress’ procedures

   These procedures support compression/decompression of individual
   bytevectors.
