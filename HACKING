#+TITLE: Hacking zlib

* Contributing

By far the easiest way to hack on zlib is to develop using Guix:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  # Obtain the source code
  cd /path/to/source-code
  guix environment -l guix.scm
  # In the new shell, run:
  hall dist --execute && autoreconf -vif && ./configure && make check
#+END_SRC

You can now hack this project's files to your heart's content, whilst
testing them from your `guix environment' shell.

If you'd like to tidy the project again, but retain the ability to test the
project from the commandline, simply run:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  ./hall clean --skip "pre-inst-env" --execute
#+END_SRC

** Manual Installation

If you do not yet use  Guix, you will have to install this project's
dependencies manually:
  - autoconf
  - automake
  - pkg-config
  - texinfo
  - guile-hall
  - zlib

Once those dependencies are installed you can run:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  hall dist -x && autoreconf -vif && ./configure && make check
#+END_SRC
